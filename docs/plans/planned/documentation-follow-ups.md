# Documentation Follow-Ups

The first public `/docs` experience shipped in `v1.6.2`. This file tracks the remaining docs work after the initial site launch.

Canonical user-facing docs live in `apps/web/content/docs`. Planning docs under `docs/plans` should describe roadmap and implementation intent, not duplicate public docs content.
