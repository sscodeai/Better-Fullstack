# Guidelines

This folder contains extended project guidance for AI agents working in Better-Fullstack.

Usage rules:

- Do not read every file here by default. Start from `AGENTS.md`, then open only the guideline file that matches the task.
- Keep these files focused on reusable project knowledge, not one-off task notes.
- If a guideline becomes stale, update the guideline and the `AGENTS.md` index together.

Files:

- `architecture-and-ownership.md` - monorepo layout, package responsibilities, and where edits belong
- `stack-options-and-compatibility.md` - canonical option metadata, aliases, schema ownership, and compatibility constraints
- `generator-change-playbook.md` - template-generation change flow, snapshot expectations, and output validation
- `web-builder-and-url-state.md` - stack builder state handling, URL encoding, lazy loading constraints, and route gotchas
- `testing-release-and-upstream.md` - verification commands, release-focused CI, and upstream backport workflow
- `scripted-cli-runs.md` - non-interactive CLI rules, prompt avoidance, and matrix caveats
- `production-package-testing.md` - production `bun create better-fullstack@latest` validation workflow and combo-ledger rules
- `template-output-and-validation.md` - template conditional logic, generated output validation, sync test discipline, and framework-specific constraints
- `remotion-video-style.md` - default visual style, color system, motion rules, and branding for Remotion videos in this project
- `design-reading-guide.md` - ordered index of all in-repo design specs (agent skills + BF Remotion style), precedence rules, and verification commands for agents reading “all designs”
- `adding-new-tool-options/` - complete guide for adding new tool/library options to any ecosystem
  - `README.md` - master guide: checklists, both scenarios (existing category vs new category), area-by-area file reference, ecosystem rules, naming conventions, common mistakes
  - `worked-example.md` - complete end-to-end walkthrough adding "opensearch" to Search, with every file diff and new-category wiring patterns
  - `templates-and-handlers.md` - `processTemplatesFromPrefix()` reference, Handlebars helpers, conditional patterns, and ecosystem handler differences (Rust/Go/Python vs TypeScript)
  - `testing.md` - both test APIs (`runTRPCTest` vs `createVirtual`), utility functions, assertion patterns, and which tests auto-detect missing files
  - `routing-gotchas.md` - edge cases: Convex backend skips, self-backend routing, Redwood paths, frontend array detection, processor ordering, auth+payments interactions
  - `compatibility-rules.md` - when/how to add disabled reasons, auto-adjustments, hard blocks, preflight warnings; backend/frontend matrices for deploy targets; research checklist
